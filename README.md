Turus HTML Template Docs

Turus is Premium one-page HTML5 template, fully responsive with

butter smooth animation

Put It Online

After you’ve downloaded the template you’ll probably want to edit the files in order to put you own

texts and images into the theme. You will need HTML/CSS skills to do this and a HTML editor like

Sublime Text, Notepad++ etc

Assuming you already have your domain and hosting :) you will have to use FTP client software like

FilleZilla​ to upload files to your server in public_html directory.

Now you can access your new website using web address in web browser like Chrome, Firefox,

Internet Exploreror Safari.

Replacing Images

Photos and Illustrations are not included in the package as they are used for demo purpose

only.

Images in the package are loading ​ placeholder.com​ dummy image. To replace the image simply

search for “via.placeholder.com” keyword. Proper image sizes are also written in the url, for

example: ​ via.placeholder.com/100x80

SEO Search Engine Optimization

In order to improve your search engine ranking, and thus enable your web site to appear among

search results, please don’t forget to change the description and keywords with your own.

<​ title​ > ​ Turus​ </​ title​ >
<​ meta​ name=​ "description"​ content=​ "Premium Onepage Theme"​ >
<​ meta​ name=​ "keywords"​ content=​ "Some keywords that best describes your
site"​ >

As a best practice, the keywords from the meta tag are words that you should use in the texts

from the page.Support

be put on a lower priority due to their nature. Support is also 100% optional and we provide it for

your connivence, so please be patient, polite and respectful.
